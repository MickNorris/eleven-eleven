# eleven-eleven


 A twitter bot that tweets 11:11 twice a day, and gives a mention to the first 3 people to retweet it.
 
 It's a dumb novelty bot, but I think if the sense of novelty last long enough, the bot could possibly grow itself. By requiring users to interact with the bot to play, the bot will have more activity and hopefully twitters algorithm will show it to more people.
 
 
 I plan on occasionaly tweaking how the "game" works as I learn what people like and are willing to do.
